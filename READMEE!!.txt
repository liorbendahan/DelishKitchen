Heyy and thank you for clicking me!!

If the server doesnt go up, then you need to do just one thing!
And its connect to the db cloud (updating your ip addressin our db whitelist), you need to open the MongoDb atlas cloud.
Open this url: 

https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?nds=true&_ga=2.93228765.1528287797.1655549867-1721196446.1655455828&_gac=1.17887179.1656264246.CjwKCAjwh-CVBhB8EiwAjFEPGaLHCjIF-Iy0GHDEhBN5L38DniEe5JTZHfJ92qkrh7bWHpfC998olhoCbuUQAvD_BwE

Now enter this email: ls.bendahan@gmail.com
And the password: Lior.123456

Nice! now after you enter in the "Security" click "network access"
and then "add ip address". then add your current ip address. 

If you are able to access the db without putting your ip in the cloud,
thats why I able everyone to access the db.

For starting the app:
Open 2 terminals, one will be for the server and one for the client.
In the first one write "cd client" and in the second one "cd server"
after clicking enter, write in both terminals "npm start".
Nice! now enjoy!
